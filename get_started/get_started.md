`scvi-tools` (single-cell variational inference tools) is a package for probabilistic modeling of single-cell omics data, built on top of PyTorch and AnnData. The package hosts implementations of models that perform a wide range of single-cell data analysis tasks, as well as the building blocks to rapidly prototype new probabilstic models.

## Installation

`scvi-tools` can be installed with `pip` or `conda`:

```
pip install scvi-tools
```

```
conda install scvi-tools -c conda-forge
```

To leverage a GPU for inference, a version of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) that supports your GPU will need to be installed separately.
