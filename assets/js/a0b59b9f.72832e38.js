Indeed increasing the number of epochs for mini-batch size 512 lead to on par performance using 5,000 instead of the default 2,500 training epochs, while performance of mini-batch size 1,024 was still inferior when checking with 10,000 training epochs."),(0,i.kt)("img",{alt:"MERFISH",width:"100%",src:(0,o.Z)("img/blog-post-destvi-batchsize/MERFISH2.png")}),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Figure 4: Results on MERFISH brain dataset.

Most likely it is safe to increase the mini-batch size for big datasets and getting runtime benefits. However, we have most experience from experiments with a batch size of 128 and limit the maximum batch size to this value. If runtime is a big concern, manual increase of this parameter is possible.
