## Introduction

scvi‚Äëtools v1.3 (covering releases 1.3.0, 1.3.1, and 1.3.2) marks a watershed moment in single-cell analytics. Featuring nine new or enhanced models‚Äîoptimized for spatial, cytometry, methylation, perturbation, and multi‚Äëomic data‚Äîit also introduces streaming data loaders for large-scale datasets, multi‚ÄëGPU model training, on-the-fly metric tuning, and integrated model interpretability. This article delves into each enhancement with depth, including detailed insights, illustrative figures, and manuscript references.

## 1. üî¨ New Models

### **ResolVI**
ResolVI is a spatial transcriptomics denoising model that reallocates mis-assigned gene counts among true cells, neighborhood leakage, and background. It employs a Gaussian-mixture latent prior to learn corrected counts and interpretable embeddings. In tutorials, it has been shown to markedly enhance spatial expression accuracy in noisy segmentation settings, enabling reliable differential expression‚Äîespecially in high-throughput ST datasets.

### **scVIVA**
Going beyond single-cell transcriptional profiling, scVIVA jointly models intrinsic gene expression and local cellular niches. It constructs a niche-aware VAE that integrates neighborhood counts and cell-type composition, enabling researchers to identify microenvironment-dependent gene regulation. Its latent embeddings delineate tissue-specific structures‚Äîideal for spatial differential abundance or niche-focused clustering studies.

---

### **CytoVI**
CytoVI brings totalVI-inspired modeling to cytometry and mass cytometry data. It models protein-marker distributions, corrects for dropouts and technical batch variation, and generates embeddings for downstream clustering and abundance inference. Tutorials demonstrate CytoVI‚Äôs capability to distinguish subtle immune subpopulations across batches, bringing probabilistic rigor to CyTOF analysis.

---

### **VIVS**
Variational Inference for Variable Selection (VIVS) performs interpretable cross-modality feature selection‚Äîlike gene‚Äìprotein associations‚Äîwhile formally controlling false discoveries. Illustrated in *Genome Biology* 2024, VIVS effectively maps regulatory relationships in multi-omic datasets, balancing interpretability and scalability with conditional randomization testing and latent selection.

---

### **SysVI**
SysVI tackles major batch effects‚Äîsuch as those arising from cross-species or organoid-versus-tissue studies‚Äîusing latent cycle-consistency and VampPrior regularization. Compared to Harmony or scVI, SysVI excels at aligning technical systems while preserving true biological variance, producing embedding spaces where analogous cell types across batches cluster coherently.

---

### **Decipher**
Designed to dissect perturbation effects (e.g., disease versus control), Decipher disentangles shared and condition-specific variation within a VAE framework. Demonstrated on AML data, it uncovers latent axes aligning with known disease signatures and identifies corresponding differentially expressed genes‚Äîbridging latent space analysis and functional biology.

---

### **MethylVI**
MethylVI is a VAE tailored for single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS‚Äëseq). By modeling methylation probabilities at genomic regions, it captures epigenetic heterogeneity and learns latent spaces that integrate multiple batches. Tutorials show it outperforms linear methods like PCA in retaining biologically meaningful methylation structures.

---

### **MethylANVI**
MethylANVI extends the MethylVI framework with annotation-aware modeling: it jointly integrates methylation profiles with metadata-driven cell-type labels. This supervised model supports both clustering and label transfer, all while capturing latent biological variation across methylome profiles‚Äîideal for epigenetic atlas-building.

---

### **totalANVI**
totalANVI brings supervised annotation to CITE‚Äëseq-style multi-omic integration. Leveraging a VAE for RNA + protein, it jointly learns latent embeddings and cell-type classifiers. The model simultaneously performs dimensionality reduction, denoising, differential expression, and accurate cell-type annotation in one cohesive model.

## 2. üß© Custom Dataloaders

scvi‚Äëtools v1.3 introduces three scalable streaming dataloaders‚ÄîLaminDB, Census, and AnnCollection‚Äîenabling out-of-core and federated training without memory overload.

- **LaminDB** streams data directly from Lamindb collections, letting users train SCVI-like models on terabyte-scale datasets stored on disk, with no changes to the training pipeline or performance drop-offs.

- **Census** employs TileDB for atlas-scale tensor-backed data, offering similar streaming capabilities but enhanced support for multi-dimensional genomic inputs and federated study designs.

- **AnnCollection** allows seamless union of multiple AnnData sources‚Äîperfect for interfacing independent experiments‚Äîwithout manual concatenation or feature alignment. The system handles missing modalities and automatically harmonizes variables across datasets.

These backends support full compatibility with scvi‚Äëtools' data registration and training workflows, offering both scale and convenience to large projects.

## 3. ‚öôÔ∏è Core Enhancements

### Multi‚ÄëGPU Training  
Built on PyTorch Lightning, v1.3 empowers all major models (SCVI, totalVI, SysVI, etc.) to run across multiple GPUs with a single API flag. Training benchmarks on million-cell datasets show training times reduced by 2‚Äì3√ó, with full gradient synchronization and no code modifications needed.

---

### scIB‚ÄëMetrics Optimization  
scvi‚Äëtools now integrates evaluation of scIB clustering metrics (like NMI and batch ARI) during training via `ScibCallback`, and supports hyperparameter tuning via `AutotuneExperiment`. This enables scientists to automatically optimize latent dimension size, learning rate, or architecture based on validation performance‚Äîmaking the model training process more principled and outcome-driven.

---

### Explainability & Interpretability  
v1.3 brings native support for **Integrated Gradients** (IG) across generative models like CondSCVI, peakVI, and totalVI. Users can compute gene-level attribution scores tied to latent dimensions or differential axes. This complements `get_normalized_expression`, delivering a full pipeline that links model representations back to biologically interpretable molecular mechanisms.

---

## Summary

scvi‚Äëtools v1.3 is a landmark release that advances the field across three foundational pillars:

1. **Innovative modeling** across nine tailored VAEs for spatial, protein, methylation, perturbation, and multi‚Äëomic data.

2. **Scalable data processing** with three new streaming backends, enabling efficient handling of federated, atlas-scale datasets.

3. **Infrastructure and transparency** with multi-GPU training, metric-aware tuning, and demonstrable model interpretability.

Together, these developments empower researchers to build, train, and interpret probabilistic models at scale‚Äîin a reproducible, transparent, and biologically meaningful way.
