## Introduction

We’re proud to introduce scvi‑tools v1.3, encompassing major advances in modeling, data loading, computational scalability, metric integration, and interpretability in single-cell analytics. 

Featuring nine new or enhanced models, optimized for spatial, cytometry, methylation, perturbation, and multi‑omic data, it also introduces custom data loaders for large-scale datasets, multi‑GPU model training, on-the-fly metric tuning, and integrated model interpretability. 

This article delves into each enhancement with depth, including detailed insights, illustrative figures, and manuscript references.

## 1. 🔬 New Models

### ResolVI
ResolVI[^1] is a spatial transcriptomics denoising model that reallocates mis-assigned gene counts among true cells, neighborhood leakage, and background. It employs a Gaussian-mixture latent prior to learn corrected counts and interpretable embeddings. This approach is highly scalable (handling >1 million spots) and offers downstream capabilities like differential expression and transfer learning on corrected data

In [tutorial](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/spatial/resolVI_tutorial.html), it has been shown to markedly enhance spatial expression accuracy in noisy segmentation settings, enabling reliable differential expression especially in high-throughput ST datasets.

### scVIVA
scVIVA[^2] augments spatial transcriptomics analysis by jointly modeling each cell’s own expression and its micro-environmental context (neighborhood composition and gene counts). This niche-aware VAE embeds both cellular identity and environmental features, revealing tissue-specific patterns and environment-driven variation. Its latent embeddings delineate tissue-specific structures - ideal for spatial differential abundance or niche-focused clustering studies.

Dedicated [tutorial](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/spatial/scVIVA_tutorial.html) showcase how scVIVA enables niche-focused clustering and differential abundance analyses

Genes are colored by their marker label (yellow=significantly upregulated in $\textit{G1}$ vs $\textit{N1}$, green otherwise).
We also display the classifier decision boundary (the predicted probability of being in the yellow class).

### CytoVI
CytoVI[^3] brings totalVI-inspired modeling to cytometry and mass cytometry data. It models protein-marker distributions, corrects for dropouts and technical batch variation, and generates embeddings for downstream clustering and abundance inference. 

Early [tutorial](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/cytometry/CytoVI_tutorial.html) already demonstrate clear delineation of immune subpopulations across batch-affected datasets.

---

### VIVS
Variational Inference for Variable Selection (VIVS[^4]) identifies associations across modalities such as gene–protein couplings—while rigorously controlling false discovery rates using conditional randomization. VIVS achieves interpretable and scalable feature selection, enabling discovery of biologically meaningful links in paired datasets

Tutorial in scvi-tools soon to be updated.

---

### SysVI
SysVI[^5] tackles major batch effects, such as those arising from cross-species or organoid-versus-tissue studies—using latent cycle-consistency and VampPrior regularization. Compared to Harmony or regular scVI models, SysVI excels at aligning technical systems while preserving true biological variance, producing embedding spaces where analogous cell types across batches cluster coherently.

in the [tutorial](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/scrna/sysVI.html), we show the power of sysVI with data integration between human and mouse immune cells.

### Decipher
Decipher[^6] Designed to dissect perturbation effects (e.g., disease versus control), Decipher disentangles shared and condition-specific variation within a VAE framework. [Demonstrated](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/scrna/decipher_tutorial.html) on AML (acute myeloid leukemia) data, it uncovers latent axes aligning with known disease signatures and identifies corresponding differentially expressed markers - bridging latent space analysis and functional biology.

---

### MethylVI
MethylVI[^7] is a VAE tailored for single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS‑seq). By modeling methylation probabilities at genomic regions, it captures epigenetic heterogeneity and learns latent spaces that integrate multiple batches. [Tutorial](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/scbs/MethylVI_batch.html) show it outperforms linear methods like PCA in retaining biologically meaningful methylation structures.

### MethylANVI
MethylANVI extends the MethylVI framework with annotation-aware modeling: it jointly integrates methylation profiles with metadata-driven cell-type labels. This supervised model supports both clustering and label transfer, all while capturing latent biological variation across methylome profiles, ideal for epigenetic atlas-building.

---

### totalANVI
totalANVI brings supervised annotation to CITE‑seq-style multi-omic integration. Leveraging a VAE for RNA + protein, it jointly learns latent embeddings and cell-type classifiers. The model simultaneously performs dimensionality reduction, denoising, differential expression, and accurate cell-type annotation in one cohesive model.

Tutorial in scvi-tools soon to be updated.

### mrVI in pyTorch
MrVI[^8] (Multi-resolution Variational Inference) is a model written in [Jax](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/thinking_in_jax.html) for analyzing multi-sample, multi-batch single-cell RNA-seq data. MrVI is particularly suited for single-cell RNA sequencing datasets with comparable observations across many samples. It conducts both exploratory analyses (locally dividing samples into groups based on molecular properties) and comparative analyses (comparing pre-defined groups of samples in terms of differential expression and differential abundance) at single-cell resolution. 

In recent scvi-tools releases we added a Pytorch implementation of mrVI, to be along with the Jax one, to support broader options on how to use this popular model. 

Tutorial of mrVI in torch running on a subset of [Tahoe100M](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.20.639398) cells dataset can be found [here](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/hub/Tahoe100_mrVI.html)

## 2. 🧩 Custom Dataloaders

scvi‑tools v1.3 introduces three scalable custom dataloaders: LaminDB, Census, and AnnCollection, enabling out-of-core and federated training without memory overload.
Custom Dataloaders are only supported in SCVI & SCANVI models, but it should be easy to expand them to other models.
These backends support full compatibility with scvi‑tools data registration and training workflows, offering both scale and convenience to large projects.

### LaminDB 
Integrates with [Lamindb](https://lamin.ai/), enabling out-of-core training from disk-backed collections. Users can register collections and seamlessly train models like SCVI using lamin's MappedCollection, benefiting from disk efficiency while maintaining full API compatibility with in-memory datasets. For more information see this [link](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/user_guide/use_case/custom_dataloaders.html).

The next [tutorial](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/use_cases/custom_dl/lamin.html) shows demonstration of a scalable approach to training an scVI model on PBMC data using Lamin dataloader.

### Census 
employs [TileDB-SOMA](https://www.tiledb.com/) for atlas-scale tensor-backed data, offering similar streaming capabilities but enhanced support for multidimensional genomic inputs and federated study designs.
This custom dataloader directly read cellXgene dataset from S3 and train the SCVI model without the need to first download it, thus very suitable for few shots learning.

The next [tutorial](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/use_cases/custom_dl/tiledb.html) shows demonstration of a scalable approach to training an scVI model on mus_musculus data using the Census dataloader

---

### AnnCollection 
This dataloader allows training on multiple AnnData objects simultaneously, without merging them into one dataset. AnnCollection handles disparities in features or layers internally and aligns them during training, empowering federated or multi-study analyses

The next [tutorial](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/use_cases/custom_dl/ann_collection.html) shows how to apply the annCollection wrapper in scvi-tools to load and train SCANVI model on several adata's that are stored on disk.
Another [link](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/hub/Tahoe100.html) shows how the [Tahoe100M](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.20.639398) cells dataset was trained in SCVI using the annCollection wrapper and its minified version was stored on scvi-hub for further analysis.

## 3. ⚙️ Core Enhancements

### Multi‑GPU Training  
Built on PyTorch Lightning, v1.3 empowers all major models to run across multiple GPUs with a single API flag. Training benchmarks times reduced by number of GPU exists, with full gradient synchronization and no code modifications needed.
See the following [tutorial](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/use_cases/multiGPU.html) and info [page](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/user_guide/use_case/multi_gpu_training.html)

### scIB‑Metrics Optimization  
With the integration of `ScibCallback` and the `AutotuneExperiment` class, users can now monitor [scIB metrics](https://github.com/YosefLab/scib-metrics) on the validation set during training and automatically tune hyperparameters (model, training and architecture parameters) based on these metrics—directly optimizing for clustering and batch mixing performance, making the model training process more principled and outcome-driven.
See the following [tutorial](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/use_cases/autotune_scvi.html#tuning-over-integration-metrics-with-scib-metrics)

---

### Explainability & Interpretability  
v1.3 brings native support for [Captum's](https://captum.ai/api/integrated_gradients.html) Integrated Gradients (IG) across semi-supervised generative models like Scanvi and totalANVI. Users can compute marker-level attribution scores tied to latent dimensions or differential axes. This complements `get_normalized_expression`, delivering a full pipeline that links model representations back to biologically interpretable molecular mechanisms, offering transparency and interpretability in deep generative modeling

See the following [tutorial](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/use_cases/interpretability.html) as an example of scanvi model ran on a PBMC dataset from 10X.
